			<h2> Reasons Why I love Logic</h2>
				<p> Although there are many "real" rappers out there, Logic is the one of the few that raps about his personal issues in his music. He mentions how his mother tried killing him and how his step father showed him how to cook crack at 12. Despite a very harsh upbringing and getting kicked out of school, Logic has shown us that you can succeed!If Logic can make it through so much, there is no reason why I can make it through my hardships! </p>

			<h2>Favorite Logic Lines </h2>
				<p> Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up Fuck around and get messed up When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine You know that I'm one of a kind Lemme get it right now, ho Draped up and I'm dripped out Right now, ho Caked up 'til I cash out And I got em all wondering how, so On the down low, haters drown slow On the down low, haters drown slow </p>
			
				<p>I got a date with destiny My heart says yeah but can't convince the rest of me I tried so hard to make it with no recipe My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me I need redemption no need to mention my past </p>
